# hellopython
My first set of python programs.

These are a few of the first Python programs I created in order to gain a better understanding of the language. I created these simple programs on Linux OS, and they run using Python version 3. Following is a list of some of programs and a brief description of what they do:

-deleted this line

-factorial.py: This is a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

-functions.py: A list of useful functions including unit conversions, cubing and squaring of numbers, etc.

-total.py: This program finds the sum of the numbers in a list.
